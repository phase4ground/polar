### Playing with successive cancellation decoding of [polar codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_code_(coding_theory))

To study polar codes I've started implementing a soft decision decoder using [saturating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_arithmetic) [fixed-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic) operations.
